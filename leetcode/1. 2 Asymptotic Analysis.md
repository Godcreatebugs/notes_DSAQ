- asymptotic means when when value is tend to something in laymann's terms 
- so for analysis the as seen in [[1. 1 Analysis of Algorithm]] , we need something that is independant of machine, language of programming etc 
- and one way to see this is *order of growth* (ad def would be good)
# order of growth
- a good analysis in hindsight would be analysis where we see how an algorithm performs with increased output. so in simpler terms if we increase n to more and more how does the algorithm perform
- **in other words constants do not matter as much as order of expression.
- if we have quadratic expression we know that regardless of machine capablity and other constraining actors at some point linear express will start performing better

this is connected to [[Need for asymptotic analysis]]
