- [[Need for asymptotic analysis ]]
- Every programmer can write different program on different machine which has differenet capacity 
- There could be some machines which are faster than the other 
- The performance of an algorithms is also dependant on which programming language you are using. 
-for example C++ is faster than Java and python 
- it also can happen that for certain i/p it runs better than other i/p 
- **to avoid this we use asymptotic analysis**
