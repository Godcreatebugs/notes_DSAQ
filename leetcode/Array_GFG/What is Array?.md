- a contiguos data structure with same data type stored at location
- its linear
- think of it as a flight of stairs
- memory is allocated using [[static memory allocation]]

Again the way we retrieve element is basically through index, index starts with 0. 
 - **making index 0 makes easy to count steps b/w 2 elements, everytime you wont have to do - 1 **

* contigious memory location and homogeneous DS

# representation of array

- in languages like c and c++ you have to define how many memory units you will assign hence,
    for e.g **int array[10]**
		    - this basically means you want to assign 10 memory units continuously in variable named array.
			- Python is a little diff , it has [[Dynamic Memory Allocation]] and hence the size itself will grow and shrink based on inputs coming in
